<!--
	Medius is the central city of the game world. It is a relatively large city
	that is known for its temples, trade houses, unique stone architecture and
	also for its three awe inspiring obelisks: Equitas, Otium, and Prosperitas.
	There are three major districts in the city, each named after the obelisk
	around which they are centered.

	The city rests against a bay known as the "Median Bay". The Imbrium river
	runs through the center of the prosperity district. Along with two major
	aqueducts that run water from the mountains from the north and south this
	river supplies much of the city's fresh water.

			Ornate copper statues depicting wealth, abundance, and health dot the well groomed gardens
			of the square. At its center towering two hundred feet above the square stands the
			Prosperity Obelisk. The obelisk itself is built of thousands of smoothed stone blocks and
			at its base it is surrounded by ziggurat of eleven perfectly square marble steps. The southern
			side of the obelisk contains a large copper dedication plaque.

			Various shops and trade houses lie on the edges of the square. They include,
