# Skill: Block (str/vit)
The block skill allows the character to effectively use a shield in battle thus
reducing the amount of damage taken over time. Note that some passive
enhancements and actions can be used with two handed weapons, but at a penalty.

The following passive enhancements are unlocked at the indicated level:

- [5]   Deflect  - Increases the chance of deflecting a blow if wearing a shield
                   or using a two-handed weapon. Chance increases with skill
                   level.
- [40]  Defender - Decrease all damage by 5-15% when wearing a shield (damage
                   reduction is based on skill level).
- [100] Reflect  - Chance to completely nullify an incoming attack and reflect
                   the damage back onto the attacker.

The following cooldown actions are added at the given levels:

- [10]  Bash         - Bash the opponent with your shield dealing 50% attack
                       damage with a chance to stun them for a number of rounds.
- [25]  Topple       - Deflect a blow from the opponent toppling them to the
                       ground, this leaves the opponent prone for one round.
- [65]  Throat Smash - Turning her shield sideways the character chops it into
                       the opponent's throat dealing a full attack and silencing
                       the opponent for a number of turns.
- [100] Pin          - Dashing forward the character pins an opponent to a
                       nearby wall or surface for a number of turns. While
                       pinned the opponent is unable to take any actions but can
                       still be attacked and take damage.
