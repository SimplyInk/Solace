# Skills
A skill encompasses a general category of actions regarding an aspect of
warfare, crafting, or manipulation in the game world. Every skill has a level
from 1 to 100 which indicates a character's proficiency.

Skills provide characters with access to weapon and armor proficiences, provide
passive enhancements, unlock cooldown actions, and provide additional commands
that can be used to manipulate the game world.
