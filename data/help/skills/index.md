# Skills
A skill encompasses a general category of actions regarding an aspect of
warfare, crafting, or manipulation in the game world. Every skill has a level
from 1 to 100 which indicates a character's proficiency.

Skills provide characters with access to weapon and armor proficiences, provide
passive enhancements, unlock cooldown actions, and provide additional commands
that can be used to manipulate the game world.

Finally, each skill is associated with two ability scores that have an
additional effect on how well the character performs skill actions, and how
effective passive enhancements are.

Here is a list of each skill with a brief description:

* One-handed - proficiency with one handed weapons fighting
* Two-handed - proficiency with large two handed weapons fighting
* Block - actions and passives that increase shield skill and utility
* Light Armor - light armor proficiency (e.g. leathers, hides, etc.)
* Heavy Armor - heavey armor proficiency (e.g. plate, scale, etc.)
